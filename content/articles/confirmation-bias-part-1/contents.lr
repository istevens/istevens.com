!! A while back I volunteered to contribute to a book on the behaviours and
history of political, legal, and socio-economic systems. It was to be a primer
for those creating products with the potential to disrupt those systems. My contribution was a chapter on
confirmation bias, detailing its effects, its workings, and how it can be
overcome. Though the book was never published, my research had me reconsidering my
behaviour. Always careful with my words, I started speaking even more purposefully,
not wanting to pass bias on to others. The experience had such an impact that I
couldn't let my chapter sit unread, and split it into three articles. This is the first
of the three, describing the pernicious influence of confirmation bias. The
other two explain how it grows and spreads, and what we can do to fight it.

"We're getting reports — around the world — of a disease rapidly spreading out
of control. The infected are in the millions, and have started behaving
irrationally. Some have been seen making poor judgments of their and others'
ability. Girls as young as six with the disease are viewing women as less
smart than men. Scientists are working on a cure, but a viable
solution could be weeks away. In the meantime, everyone is urged to use
caution."

The story and the disease might not be real — but the symptoms are, and almost
everyone on Earth is affected. If it were a disease, there might be a cure, or
at least a way to slow the contagion. There isn't. It's us, or more
specifically our brains.

You may know this affliction as _confirmation bias_, one of many cognitive or
unconscious biases which affect how we reason. Unlike a leaning or a slant,
like left- or right-wing bias, cognitive biases are the result of involuntary
mental "short-cuts", leftovers from when we had to quickly tell friend from
foe, or avoid potentially dangerous situations.  These short-cuts may
have kept our ancestors alive, but they impede logic and accuracy necessary in
our modern world. [^NELSON2015]

Before confirmation bias had a name, people were thought to be largely
rational. An error in judgment was simply a matter of poor
reasoning. [^LARRICK2004] In his recount of the Peloponnesian War almost 2500 years ago, historian Thucydides
called confirmation bias a "habit":

> "… and their judgment was based more upon blind wishing than upon any sound
> prediction; for it is a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what
> they long for, and to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not
> desire."
>
> [Thucydides, 460BC&#x2011;395BC](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thucydides#Book_IV)

Over 400 years ago, Sir Francis Bacon was more inclined to treat confirmation bias as a
trick of the mind:

> "The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion […]
> draws all things else to support and agree with it. And though there be a greater
> number and weight of instances to be found on the other side, yet these it
> either neglects and despises, or else by some distinction sets aside and
> rejects, in order that […] its former conclusions may remain inviolate."
>
> [Sir Francis Bacon, 1561&#x2011;1626](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon#Book_I)

It wasn't until 1960, when psychologist Peter Wason performed his first
selection experiment, that confirmation bias finally had a name.

<figcaption><strong>Fig. 1</strong> Wason's selection experiment. Most people tested triplets which confirmed their rule, often based on the initial triplet (left). Only a few people rationally chose test triplets which didn't confirm their rule (right). The actual rule was always "any ascending sequence."</figcaption>
</figure>

Wason's experiment was simple: present a person with three numbers (e.g.
2-4-6), and ask them to guess the rule for those numbers. That
person was then directed to test their theory with their own triplets,
and was told when each matched the _actual_ rule. Participants often
came up with rules specific to the initial triplet (e.g. "numbers
increasing by two" in the case of 2-4-6), and only tested them with triplets
which fit their theory (e.g. 9-11-13). They rarely chose triplets
which didn't agree with their theory (e.g. 9-10-11). Most, then, never
guessed the actual rule, which was always "any ascending sequence."
Fig. 1 shows an example of the irrational approach most people took,
as well as a rational one. One of the tendencies which supports
confirmation bias involves improper selection of evidence.

<aside>Confirmation bias leads us to hold false beliefs with a confidence greater than evidence can justify.</aside>

[summarize tendencies, possibly chart or infographic] Of the many cognitive biases, confirmation bias likely does us the
most harm. It tricks us into accepting untruths and nurtures them
until we're certain they're true. It leads us to hold false
beliefs with a confidence greater than evidence can justify.
[^NICKERSON1998] Those affected will often misinterpret new
information as supporting a previously-held but false belief. [^RABIN1999]
[Thanks to confirmation bias we may readily observe and recall
unusual behaviours in people from distinct ethnicities. This
tendency, left unchecked, can contribute to racist stereotypes.
[^NICKERSON1998] — awkward, out-of-place]

It may not seem dangerous, but confirmation bias can change the way we view reality. As with the
Wason experiment, we may only see what our beliefs lead us to
expect. We may also add weight to information or events which support
our theories, and discount information which does not. Bias may also
cause us to filter out opposing views and supporting facts, leading
to over-confidence in our beliefs. Over-confidence, in turn, can lead
us to bad choices, sometimes resulting in risky and extreme
behaviour. [^RABIN1999]

Horoscopes are a mild example of how bias can affect behaviour. Perhaps
you know someone who, in some small way, has acted on the advice of a
horoscope or a psychic. Such mediums remain popular largely
because we want to believe them. To reinforce our belief, we tend
focus on or remember what we expect or want from them. We also more
readily recall the times they were right, and forget or discount them
when they were wrong.
People also feel that universally positive traits [like…?] apply to
them, without considering how widespread those traits really
are. This opens us to place faith in astrology, fortune-tellers, and con
artists, who — knowingly or not — appeal to those traits so that we recognize
ourselves in their "predictions". [^NICKERSON1998]

This same tendency to see or remember what we expect or desire can also feed
more serious conditions such as hypochondria and paranoia. Depressed people
may also focus on information which strengthens their depression, and ignore
more positive information which may help them. [^NICKERSON1998]

[Chart of tendencies?]

Tendencies contributing to confirmation bias can lead us to confidently make bad
decisions which affect ourselves and others. Maybe you know
someone — a friend or relative — who seems to have nothing good to
say about a particular group. Have they gone out of their way to
avoid a member of that group? or treated someone in that group
differently than they would others? Such stereotypes and prejudices
are largely fed by confirmation bias, and can influence how we treat
or view "others". [Tie back to "friend and foe".]

[Shorter, leaner paragraph] The selective memory behind our tendency to see what we are led to
expect can be detrimental to our opinion of people or groups.  It
can confirm our belief, and lead us to more readily recall unusual
behaviour from distinct groups. Belief tainted by memory increases
our confidence in stereotypes, leading us to more likely act on
them. [^NELSON2015] Thinking back to a group you [Provide distance with bigot relative?] may mistrust, which
negative behaviours do you associate with that group? How about
positive or benign ones? Several studies have shown how bias can
change our reactions to people about whom we hold stereotypes — even
if we are only *told* those people belong to a specific group.
[^NICKERSON1998]

<aside>The tendency to make biased decisions based on confidence
in a stereotype isn't born of years of prejudicial thinking</aside>

In one such study, participants were shown a video of a girl playing. Half
were told the girl's parents were college-educated with white-collar jobs.
They were shown the girl playing in a well-to-do suburban
neighbourhood. The other half was told the girl's parents were
high-school graduates with blue-collar jobs, and were shown her playing
in a disadvantaged urban neighbourhood. People in each of those groups were then shown
the same video of the girl answering a series of questions, and were asked to
evaluate her reading level. The group which was told the girl was from
a well-to-do suburban family rated the girl's reading ability _significantly higher_
than the group which was told she was from a poorer neighbourhood. Both
groups saw the same Q&A video, were given no other information, yet reached
different conclusions because of how they felt about where the girl lived. [^RABIN1999]

[Awkward?] This tendency to make biased decisions based on confidence
in a stereotype isn't born of years of prejudicial thinking,
either. In a similar study, 5-7 year-olds were told
of a person who was "really, really smart." The children were then
shown a picture of four adults — two women and two men — and were asked
to pick the "really, really smart" one. At aged 5, boys and girls
chose their own gender roughly equally. Girls aged 6 or 7, however,
were significantly less likely than boys the same age to view their
own gender positively. In another study with different children,
boys and girls aged 6 or 7 were asked to comment on a game for
"really, really smart" children or one for children who "try really,
really hard." The girls were significantly less interested than the
boys in games for "really, really smart" children. [^BIAN2017]

[Picture illustrating above?]

Like Thucydides, we may feel our reasoning is
stronger than others', that we never fall into the "habit" of
misjudging people, especially a child, so easily. Yet even people
who have studied reasoning and statistics can still have a problem
with confirmation bias and stereotypes. [For instance, numerous
peer-reviewed scientific studies claim to show that women are less likely than
men to take on risk. However, a 2013 "study of studies" claims that
these studies and their authors were likely affected by stereotypes
induced by bias. [^NELSON2015] The studies' authors reached
inaccurate conclusions by falling prey to a number of tendencies
behind confirmation bias. — cut or better wording]

<aside>We don't see our bias. We feel we're being
reasonable, and we are, but with skewed information.</aside>

[Cut or sum with ref to tendencies to bias? — Some studies on risk and gender reinforce existing gender stereotypes by
inaccurately citing conclusions of earlier literature, or emphasizing results
agreeing with stereotypes, while downplaying or not reporting results which
do not. These confirming results are, in turn, more likely to be published. In
other studies, confounding variables (some due to socialization and pressure to
conform to gender expectations) were neglected. In others, areas where women
naturally take on a great deal of risk (such as with child birth, and risk of
domestic violence) were neglected. Instead, different areas of risk (such as
finance) were studied and findings extrapolated to a broader context.
[^NELSON2015] In the following paragraphs, we'll learn how tendencies such as
over-weighing instances of positive confirmation can cause confirmation bias to grow
and persist. Because we often pair these tendencies with internally coherent
patterns of reasoning, few are immune.]

Since Wason's experiment, many studies have shown that not only do we hold
biases, they can be difficult to correct. [^LARRICK2004] We
may not even know about our own confirmation bias. Worse, although our
reasoning about information may be biased, we still rationally apply that data to our
own state of the world. We don't see our bias. We feel we're being
reasonable, and we are, but with skewed information. This bias-influenced reasoning may
make sense to us, but it results in imperfect decisions. Ignorant to our bias,
we may become over-confident in our beliefs and risk tainting future reasoning,
thereby reinforcing our bias. [^JONES2000] [^RABIN1999]

Confirmation bias exists and negatively influences human behaviour — so now
what? We can correct our own bias. Awareness helps a great deal, as it turns
out. There are also habits we can pick up to better keep our bias in check.
That's in part three of this series. Our next step is to gain a better
understanding of how confirmation bias grows and spreads, which brings us to
part two.
